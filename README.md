# Calculator - Java
 A simple calculator application written in Java


 # Overview

The purpose of this program was to obtain a greater understanding of the Java Language and the implementation of using the Swing graphical user interface (GUI). 

This is a simple calculator program that enables one to perform the four main operations on a calculator: adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. It allows the use of a period "." for calculating doubles instead of only integers. It uses basic Swing libraries to create a clean user interface with orgranized buttons and display. 


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
